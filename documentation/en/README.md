## Project TACO

TACO is an initiative between Nucleus of Studies and Research in Food (NEPA) of UNICAMP with a funding from brazilian Ministry of Health (MS) and Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger (MDS) to provide data of a large number of nutrients in national and regional foods obtained through representative sampling and analysis carried out by laboratories with analytical competence proven by interlaboratory studies, according to international criteria.

## Getting started

### Docker

If you use Docker, instead running this project locally you can simply run Taco API image:

```bash
docker pull raulfdm/taco-api
```

Then, run your container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name taco -p 4000:4000 raulfdm/taco-api
```

After that, you can check the API documentation at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Running locally

To run locally, clone this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raulfdm/taco-api.git
```

Then, install all dependencies and run npm start:

```bash
cd taco-api
npm install
npm start
```

After that, you can check the API documentation at `http://localhost:4000`.

If you want to use docker and run instead, you can use docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## About this project

The main goal of this project was to take the data from original research and provide as API using modern development techniques.

Actually the original project have only 2 possible ways to consult the data:

1. By PDF file. In that case, you have to find the food you want and be sure your looking the correct value;
1. By tabulated xls. The researchers have created the XLS to be an database, however, they tabulated it and made nice to print, not to filter or to extract. Also there's 3 different sheet containing specific data for the same food.

The way they've chosen can work if you want to do a quick consult, however, if you want to build an application with this data, you have to format it to make it easy to use and that's this project about: better format.

### Step-by-step

The following steps describe the whole workflow I did to build this project:

1. Extract the original xls, cleaning unnecessary styles, columns and rows;
1. Repeat the above step for each sheet;
1. Merge all 3 sheets into one;
1. Generate a CSV (Comma-separated values) and export it to a JSON format;
1. Create another JSON file containing all `categories` and then create a relation between FOOD - Category;
1. Create 2 end-points `food` and `category` to get this data

### Official Research

In order to keep the original research as `source of truth` of this project, I've saved all available files ([got from NEPA website](http://nepa.unicamp.br/taco/tabela.php)). You can consult them in [references](./references) folder.
