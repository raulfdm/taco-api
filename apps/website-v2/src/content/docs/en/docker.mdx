title: "Deploy with docker"
---

If you are familiar with docker, you have the option of running the project from an image.
Within the repository, there is a configuration file to upload the project using docker-compose, so you can just do:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If you want to use the remote image, you can run the following:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name taco -p 4000:4000 raulfdm/taco-api
```
