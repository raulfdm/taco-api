Then, go to the taco API folder to make it easier to run the commands:

```bash
cd apps/taco
```

Now, run the server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Now the server is running at `http://localhost:4000/grapqhl`. Now just copy this address into your GraphQL client so you can run queries and view the API documentation.
