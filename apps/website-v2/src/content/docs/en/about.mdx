## the TACO Project

The TACO project (Brazilian Table of Food Composition), coordinated by the Center for Studies and Research in Food (NEPA) at UNICAMP and funded by the Ministry of Health - MS and Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger - MDS is an initiative to provide data on a large number of nutrients in national and regional foods obtained through representative sampling and analysis performed by laboratories with analytical competence proven by inter-laboratory studies, according to international criteria.

## This project

Initially, the TACO project has only 2 ways to consume this data. These are:

1. Through a PDF file. In this case, you need to search for the desired food and its values;
2. Through an Excel file (xls) which, in theory, represents the "database" of foods.

Building an application is almost impossible in both cases since we need the data correctly formatted, well structured, and with clear relationships between the information.

So the main goal of this project is to use the original TACO research data and structure it so that it is easy to build a client (mobile or web).
