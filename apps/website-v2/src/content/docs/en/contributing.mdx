To run the project locally, you will need to have installed the following:

- [NodeJS version 20 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en) - Prisma still relies on Node to generate files;
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - To install deps, build and run the server;
- A GraphQL client to be able to inspect the API.
  I recommend [Altair GraphQL](https://altairgraphql.dev/)
