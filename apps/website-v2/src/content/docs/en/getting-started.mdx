First, install all the project dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, navigate to the API folder to make it easier to run the commands:

```bash
cd apps/taco
```

Now, run the server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Once done, the server will be running on `http://localhost:4000/grapqhl`. Now, just copy this address into your GraphQL client to be able to run queries and see the API documentation.
