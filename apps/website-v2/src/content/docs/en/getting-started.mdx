You can either fork this project or clone it, the choice is yours.

First and foremost, ensure that you have installed two things on your machine:

- NodeJS version 18 or higher;
- BunJS version 1.0.15 or higher.

Now, the first step is to install the project dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

As the project is set up as a monorepo to facilitate development, I suggest navigating inside the API folder:

```bash
cd apps/taco
```

Finally, run the development server with the command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Once done, the API will be running at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
