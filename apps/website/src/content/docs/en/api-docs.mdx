title: "API Documentation"

GraphQL is a typed language for building APIs.

Due to the fact that we have to type all the schemas, it is possible to find the documentation in the very application where we are executing the queries, which benefit from the technique of ["introspection"](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/).

The project uses GraphQL Yoga, which, in addition to creating and implementing the integration of the `/graphql` route for the POST method, when it receives a GET, returns an interactive playground:

Another alternative is to use a dedicated tool for this. There are several options, such as:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Altair](https://altairgraphql.dev/) - Focused on GraphQL.
