## TACO

The TACO project (Brazilian Table of Food Composition), coordinated by the Center for Studies and Research in Food (NEPA) at UNICAMP and funded by the Ministry of Health – MS and the Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger – MDS, is an initiative to provide data on a large number of nutrients in national and regional foods, obtained through representative sampling and analyses carried out by laboratories with proven analytical competence through interlaboratory studies, according to international criteria.

## This Project

Originally, the TACO project had only two ways of consuming this data. They are:

1. Through a PDF file. In this case, you need to search for the desired food and its respective values;
2. Through an Excel file (xls) which, in theory, represents the "database" of foods.

In both cases, building an application is almost impossible, as we need the data to be correctly formatted, well-structured, and with clear relationships between the information.

Thus, the main goal of this project is to use the original data from the TACO research and structure it in such a way that it becomes easy for the development of a client (mobile or web).
