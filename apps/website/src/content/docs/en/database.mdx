title: "Database"
---

Because the project uses SQLite, and this generates a file that is being committed, you probably don't need to run any of the commands from the database.

But if you fork the project and want to make changes to the models, you will probably need to do a database migration so that the new columns/tables can be inserted.

When making any changes to the `src/infrastructure/prisma/schema.prisma` file, run the following command:

```bash
bun run db:migrate -name <change-name>
```

This will create a migration file that must be committed.

If you want to clean out the database and re-insert the original data, you can use the command:

```bash
bun run db:reset
```

If you want to see the database in a dashboard, you can run Prisma studio:

```bash
bun run studio
```
