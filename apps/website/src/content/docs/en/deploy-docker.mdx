title: "Deploy via Docker"

Another option is to deploy the application via Docker.

With each new version, a new public image is created and can be seen on [DockerHUB](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/raulfdm/taco-api/general).

Thus, in the service you choose, you can use the latest available version `raulfdm/taco-api`, or if it's via command, it would be something like:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name taco -p 4000:4000 raulfdm/taco-api
```
