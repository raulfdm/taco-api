title: "Deploy as Node app"
---

There are several ways and platforms to deploy this API.

On any platform, look for a machine that supports NodeJS applications.

Although the project uses Bun, on a machine that has Node, you can install Bun via npm:

```bash
npm add -g bun@1.2.2
```

Having installed bun globally, you can now follow the normal steps:

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install --production
```

Then, at the root of the project, run the command:

```bash
bun run start --filter=taco-api
```

This will build and run the server.

Remember that the port that needs to be open is `4000`.
