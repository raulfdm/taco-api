## Prerequisites

Before you start the initial setup, you need to have 2 runtimes installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) version 20 or higher
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) version 1.0.20 or higher

Although Bun is the primary runtime, one of the dependencies ([Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)) still requires Node to generate the initial files.

:::tip

If you already have Node installed, you can install `bun` via npm:

```bash
npm install -g bun@1.0.20
```

:::

## Configuration

You can either fork this project or clone it, the choice is yours.

Now, the first step is to install the project dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running the Server

The project is set up as a [monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/what-is-a-monorepo) (or workspace) using a tool called [turbo repo](https://turbo.build/repo).

This means that to run the server from the project root, you need to run:

```bash
bun run dev --filter=taco-api
```

## Running the Server with Docker

If you want a fully configured environment, it's also possible to run the project via Docker.

For this, at the project root, run the command:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./apps/api/docker-compose.yml up
```

:::note
The docker-compose is configured to run the API in development mode. To deploy as a docker image, visit the section [Deploy > Docker](/deploy-docker)

## Running the Documentation

If you want to edit the documentation, in the project's root directory, run the command:

```bash
bun run dev --filter=website
```
